The interpreter is what reads your code and converts that into the binary instructions that the computer can understand – think of it as translator between you and the low-level components (operating system, file system, network, display, etc.) of your machine. In these notebooks the interpreter is in the background and runs when you click the 'Run' button in a code cell (in future we'll see how we can use the Python interpreter with scripts of many lines of code).  \n\nAs we progress through the excercises we'll encounter a range of new programming concepts. At this stage don't worry too much about memorizing all of them; it is through repeated used and practice that they will eventually come naturally. Instead, here we want you to try to develop a _sense_ of what is going on and keep the concepts in mind when reading the examples... but the really important thing is to try to apply them while _doing the excercises_."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To help you get started, we have prepared an introductory video to aid your learning about the basic concepts in Python. Please note that by the time you have finished watching this video, you might need to re-launch binder.

There are four 'levels' of exercise:\n\n1. **Code from Scratch**: using examples already encountered in the lesson as a starting point, you will write some _very simple_ code (1-3 lines at most) into a blank code cell. \n2. **Supported Code**: using examples and exercises already encountered in the notebook, you will fill in somes 'gaps' in the lines of code where we've replaced some critical bits with (*???*) in order to make it work successfully.\n3. **Broken Code**: here we have deliberately broken something (sometimes, more than one thing) in the code and you will need to fix these before it will run successfully. Being able to _debug_ code is an integral part of being a programmer, and this will also require you to have an eye for detail because tiny typos and simple sloppiness are enough to break a computer program.\n4. **Applied Geo-Example**: this will be a much more advanced bit of code that will (we hope) run successfully right from the start. The point of these examples is to demonstrate a real-world _application_ of a concept covered in the lesson and we are asking you to spend some time puzzling over the code and adding comments about what you think is going on. Being able to read someone else's code and to make sense of what is going on is another crucial skill for a programmer. \n\nWe're not expecting you to master the fourth level at this stage; in fact, some of the examples might be challenging even after a full year of classes. However, we think it's important to try to show you where we're trying to go as well as the steps involved in how we get there. It's like trying to follow directions from someone who only tells you 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go straight' – it's a lot easier to fill in the gaps and to understand what's going on if they say \"We're headed to London\" first!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Simple Operations\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Numeric Operations\n\nYou already saw a really simple example of calculating the mean in Notebook 1, but let's recall that you can easily use Python to like a calculator.

What about text?\n\n### How long is a piece of string?\n\nIn most programming languages, text and words are called *strings*, which is really a fancy word to say a *sequence of characters* enclosed in single- or double-quotes (' or \"). This might seem like stating the bleedin' obvious but this is a really, really important idea... \n> \"235op\\!u\\$nlkgfd8 wp8ty fgdoy8p waklj ag9up0\" \n\nis a string.

As long as they are both marked out by single- or double-quotes then as far as the computer is concerned they are strings. So even to ask the computer how many words there in the first 3 lines of _Twelfth Night_ means we have to 'teach' the computer what a word is by giving it rules to recognise the start or end of one, and even how to recognise the start and end of a line so that it can find the first three of them!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"I'm a string of text!\")\nprint('Me too! *&($£(£_@~{}|?<>$)')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"_Note:_ As before, we'll be using the `print()` command on many lines of code; that is just a way to tell the Python interpreter to output somthing for us to see.\n\n### Single- or Double-Quotes?\n\nAlthough you can technically use either type of quote (`'` or `\"`), it is generally better to use double-quotes as a way to prevent errors if a single-quote is contained in your string:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"I'm contained within double quotes.

That's where the 'backslash' (`\\`, a kind of 'reverse division' symbol) comes in handy. The backslash is how we 'escape' characters so that we can do 'special' things with them when they should _normally_ do something else.\n\nIn the example below, the backslash in front of the apostrophe in \"I'm\" says \"Don't treat this as 'normal' single-quote that means the end of the string, treat it as a literal single-quote in the middle of a longer string marked out by single-quotes."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('I\\'m using the backslash.')\nprint('I\\'m also using the backslash \\'\\\\\\' to escape the error normally caused by having single-quotes.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look at this a little more closely:\n* The first line is easy: the backslash in front of the single-quote in \"I'm\" allows us to use single-quotes to mark the start and end of the string. This is a silly example since we could also have written `\"I'm using the backslash\"` but you get the point.\n* The second line gets a little more complicated: you'll see that we've now escaped _three_ single-quotes (there are three occurences of `\"\\'\"`). But what's happening with `\"\\\\\"`? Well, we need an extra backslash in front of the backslash so that the computer knows to print a literal backslash (we are 'escaping' the normal function of a backslash to escape the character immediately after it) instead of reading it as escaping the one in front of the single-quote.\n\nThat's pretty weird, but just to show you what's happening here it is without that extra backslash:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('I\\'m also using the backslash \\'\\\\' to escape the error normally caused by having single-quotes.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you run the code above, you'll see another error!

For example, what if we wanted to tell Python that a string contains a newline (i.e. that the string is split across one or more lines, like our Shakespeare quote above should be)? \n\nRemember that programmers are always lazy when given half a chance and so they figured out that the easiest way to mark a newline was `\\n`. They used 'n' because it is fairly easy to remember that that means '*n*ewline', and the backslash 'escapes' us from the simple world where an 'n' is the letter 'n' into the computer's world where '`n`' is 'n', but `\\n` is a newline:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"If music be the food of love, play on;\\n Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting ,\\n The appetite may sicken, and so die.\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"See how that wraps the text on the `\\n`?

There's also an extra space after 'surfeiting' before the comma.\n\n#### Why details matters\n\nWe say this a lot later too, but you might as well start learning this fact now: spaces in a string _matter_. To a computer `\" A string\"` and `\"A string\"` are _not_ the same. Notice that there is a single space in front of the 'A'. As a human being we tend to just skip over that space (especially if it's hard to see), but to a computer one string starts with 'A' and the other with ' ', so they are _completely different_.\n\nFurther, numbers and strings are _not_ the interachangeable: `\"2016\"` is _not_ the same as `2016`.

Given that a lot of programming doesn't involve solving everything in one easy line, how do you save an answer so that you can re-use it later? Let's start with the first true programming concept: the   **variable**.\n\nIf you have studied other programming languages before then the concept of the variable will be so familiar to you that it's hard to remember even having to learn it! Some people think of a [variable simply as \"a box\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0aBwgLRNXI) that contains _values_ that we want to store and retrieve in the future. However, we think it might be more useful to think of a variable as the _label_ of a box in which we put something: for programmers, the label is how we remember what we put in the box and where we put it. \n\nLet me try to explain: if you [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA) the introductory [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBDoT8o4q00) in the previous notebook, then you'll remember that the computer stores 'information' in lots of places (in memory, on the hard drive, etc.), but it doesn't use an addressing system that you or I would be able to read. Instead, it will use a long, complicated number that tells the computer \"Go look in this place for what to do when the mouse is clicked\" or \"Go look what to do when someone asks you to add together 1 and 5\". In the same way that Python translates between what we humans can deal with and what the computer can deal with, it also translates between the 'labels' that we use to refer to different boxes storing different things and how the computer finds what we _actually_ put there.\n\nHere's an example:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"result = -2 * 10","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hmmmm, nothing printed out this time... \n\nThat's because this time we gave Python a bax with the label \"result\" in which to put the result of multiplying -2 and 10."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"result = -2 * 10\nprint(\"I'm wasting space...\")\nprint(result)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"solution2":"hidden","solution2_first":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Can you check the data type of your variable **result** and switch it to float?"},{"metadata":{"solution2":"hidden","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# First, we need to check the data type of our variable using a function called \"type\"\ntype(result)\n# Rewrite the existing variable or put it as a new variable \nresult = float(result) # or result_float = float(result_float)\ntype(result) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Check it out!
