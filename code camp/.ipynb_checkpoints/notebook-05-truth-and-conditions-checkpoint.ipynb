As in:\n\n```python\nmy_var = 1\n```\n\nTo test if something is exactly equal we can use the *equality comparison operator*, which is two equals signs together (*==*). This equality comparison returns `True` if the contents of two variables/results of two calculations are equal. That's a bit of a mouthful, but all we're saying is that we compare the left-hand side (LHS) of the equality operator (`==`) with the right-hand side (RHS) to see if they evaluate to the same answer.\n\nA _lot_ of new programmers make th mistake of writing `=` in their code when they wanted `==`, and it can be hard to track this one down.

Where are we going with this? Think back to the first notebook and the example of what is happening inside a computer: _if_ the user has clicked on the mouse _then_ we need to do something (e.g. change the colour of the button, open the web link, etc.). Everything that we've done up until now basically happened on a single line: _set_ this variable, _set_ that variable, print out the result of the _comparison_. \n\nNow we're going to step it up a level.\n\nTo check a condition you will need to use a *statement* (i.e. [everything that makes up one or more lines of code line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4728073/what-is-the-difference-between-an-expression-and-a-statement-in-python) ) to see `if` that condition is True/False, in which case do one thing, or `else` do something else...\n\nLet's see that in action!\n\n## IF condition\n\nLet's start with a basic `if` statement. In Python you write it:\n\n```python\nif conditon-to-check:\n   statement\n```\n\nSo an `if` condition starts with the word `if` and ends with a colon (`:`).\n\nThe statement is the code that we want the computer to run _if_ the `condition-to-check` comes out `True`. **However**, notice that the next line – the `statement` line – is indendented. This is Python's way to define a *block of code*. \n\nA **block of code** means that we can run several lines of code _if_ the condition is True. As long as the code is indented then Python will treat it as code to run _only_ if the condition is True.\n\nLet's see a few examples. Run the following code cell and see if you can understand the output produced (given the code in the cell)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Condition 1\nif 2 > 1:\n    print(\"> Condition #1\")\n    \n# Condition 2\nif 1 > 2: \n    print(\"> Condition #2\")\n    \n# Condition 3\nif \"Foo\" == \"Foo\":\n    print(\"> Condition #3\")\n    myVar = 1 + 5\n    print(\"     My var: \" + str(myVar))\n    \n# Condition 4\nif \"Foo\" != \"Foo\":\n    print(\"> Condition #4\")\n    myVar = 1 + 5\n    print(\"     My var: \" + str(myVar))\n    \nprint(\"Done.\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"See how that works?

Python then skips the next _two_ indented lines which form part of the _code block_. It's the indentation that tells Python they're still part of the same code block. That _entire code block_ would only be executed _if_ the `condition-to-check` had been True.\n3. \"Foo\" is the same as \"Foo\", so this condition is True. Python then runs the next three lines because the indentation tells Python that they are all part of the same code block. Notice that we can even do things like set new variables in a code block.\n4. \"Foo\" is _still_ the same as \"Foo\", but we were testing if they were _not equal_ (`!=`) and so this condition is False. This time Python skips over the three lines and moves straight to the last print statement.\n5.

We'll use it to interact with the user of our program. The input is going to be saved in a variable called `user_input`.\n\nI've provided a basic scaffolding of the code. It covers the case where the user choses the City borough, or provides an invalid input. Complete the script so that the three other boroughs can be found by the user.\n\nHINT: You will need to use `elif` statements to check for the various cases that use user might input.\n"},{"metadata":{"solution2":"hidden","solution2_first":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# variable with the City borough's total population (in thousands)\ncity_of_London = 7.375\n# City borough's map marker\ncity_coords = \"http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.5151&mlon=-0.0933#map=14/51.5151/-0.0933\"\n\n# Other boroughs\n# camden = 220.338\n# camden_coords = \"http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.5424&mlon=-0.2252#map=12/51.5424/-0.2252\"\n# hackney = 246.270\n# hackney_coords = \"http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.5432&mlon=-0.0709#map=13/51.5432/-0.0709\"\n# lambeth = 303.086\n# lambeth_coords = http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.5013&mlon=-0.1172#map=13/51.5013/-0.1172\n\n# Let's ask the user for some input\n# and store his answer\nuser_input = input(\"\"\"\nChoose a neighbourhood by type the corresponding number:\n1- City of London\n2- Lambeth\n3- Camden\n4- Hackney\n\"\"\")\n\n# Arbitrarily assign case 1 to City of London borough\n\nif (user_input == '1'):    \n    choosen_borough = city_of_London\n    borough_coordinates = city_coords \n    # print the output\n    # notice we are casting the user answer to string\n    print(\"You have choosen number : \"+ str(user_input))\n    print(\"The corresponding borough has a population of \"+ str(choosen_borough) +\" thousand people\")\n    print(\"Visit the borough clicking here: \" + borough_coordinates)\n    # ---------------\n    # add more cases here...\n    # ---------------\nelse:\n    print(\"That's not in my system.
