# Citations and References

**TL;DR ** understanding Harvard citation style; learn Mendeley software (or an alternatives).

Here are my suggestions for using citations and managing references.

1. Knowing a bit of Harvard citation style

- This means that you know it when you see it, but you don't need to know every single bit of this style or manually format  citations using this style. Software is your best friend for managing the citations and references
- You should use this style in all work submitted for this course CASA0007. 
- These are some links that help you learn this citation style
  - [Harvard Format Citation Guide from Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/harvard-citation-guide)
  - [Harvard referencing conventions from UCL](https://library-guides.ucl.ac.uk/referencing-plagiarism/harvard)
2. Mastering one of Mendeley/Zetero/Endnote
- Learning at least one piece of reference managing software, including [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)/[Zetero](https://www.zotero.org/)/[Endnote](https://endnote.com/).
- What are the main differences between them? Mendeley is free but not open source; Zetero is free and open-source; Endnote is heavy, neither free nor open source. 
- If you haven't used any, you can start with Mendeley. [Here](You should use this system in all work submitted for this course. ) is the official guide to Mendeley, or you can Google *Mendeley*. If you have found better materials on Mendeley, please email me. 
- Believe or not, these software will make citing, managing and sharing references much easier. You could switch to another reference style (e.g. APA Style) in a second using these software.
- It is also super useful for building your own knowledge database.
